There are two program (.exe) to preprocess the data.

Model:
  w: the number of goods
  wi: each good
  yi: each number of good of the same category
  x1: the number of goods of the same brand
  y1: the number of goods of the same category
  x2: the number of goods of the same brand that the user bought
  y2: the number of goods of the same category that the user bought
  P(u) = (âˆ‘wi * yi)/w * ((1 + x2/x1)^x2) * ((y2/y1)^y2)
Input:
  path: ../../../Data
  goods_train.txt
  user_action_test_items.txt
Output:
  path: ../../../NewData/build2
  user.txt  // each user
  good.txt  // each good
  brand.txt  // each brand of good
  category.txt  // each category of good
  brand_number.txt  // each number of good of the same brand
  category_number.txt  // each number of good of the same category
  user_brand_number.txt  // each number of good of the same brand that the user bought
  user_category_number.txt  // each number of good of the same brand that the user bought
  good_number.txt  // the number of good
  pu.txt  // calculate the P(u)
