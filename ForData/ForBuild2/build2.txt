Model:
  w: the number of goods
  wi: each good
  yi: each number of good with the same category
  x1: the number of goods with the same brand
  y1: the number of goods with the same category
  x2: the number of goods with the same brand that the user bought
  y2: the number of goods with the same category that the user bought
  P(u) = (∑wi * yi)/w * ((1 + x2/x1)^x2) * ((y2/y1)^y2)
