Model: consider the possibility that user U will buy good G(brand B, category C)
	b1: if the user ever bought goods of brand b
	b2: if the user ever clicked goods of brand b
	c1: if the user ever bought goods of category c
	c2: if the user ever clicked goods of category c
	n1: the total goods that user u bought
	n2: the total goods that user u clicked
	n11/ n21: the number of goods(brand b) that u bought/ clicked
	n12/ n22: the number of goods(category c) that u bought/ clicked
	Pu(b): the relativity of user u and brand b
	Pu(c): the relativity of user u and category c
	P(g): the popularity of brand in category c
	
	Pu（b）=b1*（50%+（n11/n1）*50%）*50% + b2*（50%+（n21/n2）*50%）*50%
	Pu（c）=c1*（50%+（n12/n1）*50%）*50% + c2*（50%+（n22/n2）*50%）*50%P（g）=m/m0
	P（g）=m/m0
	Pu（g） = Pu（b） * Pu（c）+ P（g）
